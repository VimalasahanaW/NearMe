Mandaikadu Bhagavathi Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to the Hindu goddess Parvati (known as Bhagavathi). It is located near Colachel in the western coast of Kanyakumari district, Tamil Nadu. This is one among the most renowned and important Hindu temples in the district.

This temple on the sea shore is a sought after pilgrim centre for both people of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Due to some unknown reasons people from Kollam district in Kerala frequent this temple and according to some versions this is due to the links to erstwhile Venadu, an ancient kingdom whose capital was Kollam. Venadu traces the links to imperial Cheras, from the three kingdoms of extreme south India Chera, Chola and Pandya. These are said to be three brothers from ancient Porkai, near Thiruchendoor. Travancore kings were from the Chera lineage as believed. Many temples in the region are traced to Chera and Pandya lineages, the former more.
