Undoubtedly one of the places that offer the best scenic views and sceneries of the clear blue seas and the never-ending sky that meets it at infinity, the View Tower is located in the town of Kanyakumari in Tamil Nadu in India. The View Tower and the telescope that accompanies it provides a panoramic view of not only the surrounding seashore and landscape but also of the Vivekananda Rock Memorial, Thiruvalluvar Statue and other monuments that can be seen from there. The famous Kumari Amman Temple, which is visited by devotees from all parts of the country, is also located at a walking distance and must be visited while on a trip here.

The views of the sunrise and sunset are exceptionally breathtaking when seen from the view tower, and this is perhaps precisely why visitors flock to this destination in large numbers all year round. In fact, tourists claim that from the view tower, they feel as if they can touch the sun even though it is at a distance: this is how magnificent the views are. The gentle breeze and the captivating beauty of the view tower enchant one's mind and refresh the mind and soul. The place is also the perfect spot for photographers to capture the beauties and bounties of nature. All of these factors make the View Tower a must visit site in all of Kanykamuri, and you should include it in your itinerary while here in this part of south India.
